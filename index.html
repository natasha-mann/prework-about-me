      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am currently working in student recruitment at a UK university, but I am hoping to launch a new career in software development following this bootcamp.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from Lancashire, but I have been living in Birmingham since I moved here for university 10 years ago.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am a dancer and pre-Covid would take 3 or 4 classes per week. I also love learning languages, reading and playing piano.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm not sure I know the answer to this yet! I would love something that allows me to travel whilst keeping my brain stimulated.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Birmingham</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to work in an industry which is fast-moving, working alongside like-minded people and I think the tech industry fits that very well. I am very logically minded, have always been interested in puzzles and strategic thinking and as a linguist I think a job as a software developer would suit me very well.</p>
